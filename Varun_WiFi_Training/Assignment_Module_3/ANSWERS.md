## 2. What are DSSS and FHSS? How do they work?
Ans : 

DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) and FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) are two techniques used in wireless communication to spread the transmitted signal over a wider frequency range. This makes the signal more resistant to interference, noise, and eavesdropping.
- DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum): In DSSS, each bit of data is multiplied by a pseudo-random noise (PN) code called a chipping code. This process spreads the signal across a wider frequency band. The key benefit is that it becomes more resilient to narrowband interference since the energy is distributed over a large frequency spectrum.
At the receiver end, the same pseudo-random code is used to despread the signal and reconstruct the original data. This helps in filtering out any noise or interference that did not match the code.
DSSS is used in IEEE 802.11b Wi-Fi and offers higher data rates (up to 11 Mbps).

- FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum): FHSS divides the frequency band into many smaller channels. The transmitter and receiver both hop between these frequencies in a synchronized, pseudo-random pattern. At any given moment, the transmission happens on one of the sub-channels, and it keeps changing (hopping) periodically.
This approach makes FHSS less prone to constant interference on any single frequency and increases resistance to jamming. Even if some frequencies are blocked or noisy, the system can still communicate through other frequencies.
FHSS is more common in early 802.11 Wi-Fi and Bluetooth systems, though its data rate is typically lower compared to DSSS (up to 2 Mbps).

## 3. How do modulation schemes work in the PHY layer? Compare different modulation schemes and their performance across various Wi-Fi standards.
Ans : Modulation is the method of transforming binary data (0s and 1s) into a format suitable for wireless transmission by modifying a carrier wave's properties such as amplitude, frequency, or phase. In Wi-Fi systems, modulation plays a crucial role in improving data transmission speed, enhancing signal strength, and ensuring reliable communication based on varying environmental conditions. As the modulation order increases, each symbol carries more bits, enabling faster data rates—however, this also makes the signal more vulnerable to noise. Wi-Fi protocols commonly use phase-based modulation methods such as BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), and QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) for effective wireless data transfer.

| Modulation Scheme | Bits per Symbol | Robustness        | Speed         | Used In Wi-Fi Standards        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## 4. What is the significance of OFDM in WLAN? How does it improve performance?
Ans : **OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)** is a key modulation technique used in modern WLAN systems like Wi-Fi (from 802.11a onwards). It enhances performance by dividing a high-speed data stream into multiple lower-rate streams, which are then transmitted simultaneously over several orthogonal subcarriers. This parallel transmission makes efficient use of the available bandwidth and significantly reduces the impact of multipath interference—a common issue in indoor wireless environments where signals reflect off walls and objects.

The orthogonality of subcarriers ensures that they do not interfere with each other, allowing more data to be packed into the same frequency space. OFDM also allows flexibility in modulation per subcarrier, adapting to varying channel conditions to maintain reliable transmission. As a result, OFDM improves spectral efficiency, boosts data rates, and provides greater robustness against noise and fading, making it essential for high-speed, reliable Wi-Fi communication.

## 5. How are frequency bands divided for Wi-Fi? Explain different bands and their channels.
Ans : Wi-Fi uses multiple frequency bands—2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz, and 60 GHz—each offering different trade-offs in speed, range, and interference.

- 2.4 GHz has better range but suffers from congestion.
- 5 GHz offers faster speeds and more channels with less interference.
- 6 GHz (Wi-Fi 6E/7) provides clean spectrum for high throughput.
- 60 GHz (WiGig) supports ultra-fast, short-range communication.

| Band      | Range       | Speed         | Channels         | Usage Notes                                 |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 2.4 GHz   | Long         | Moderate       | 14 (3 non-overlapping) | High interference from common devices       |
| 5 GHz     | Medium       | High           | 25+ (non-overlapping) | Requires DFS in some regions               |
| 6 GHz     | Short-Medium | Very High      | 59 (20 MHz each) | Clean, uncongested; for Wi-Fi 6E/7         |
| 60 GHz    | Very Short   | Extremely High | Few (2.16 GHz wide)  | Line-of-sight only; used in WiGig (802.11ad/ay) |

## 6. What is the role of Guard intervals in WLAN transmission? How does a short Guard interval improve efficiency?

Ans : A Guard Interval (GI) is a brief delay added between consecutive symbols during transmission in Wi-Fi systems that use OFDM. Its main function is to minimize inter-symbol interference (ISI), which can occur when signals bounce off surfaces like walls, furniture, or other obstacles. These reflections, known as multipath signals, may arrive at the receiver with a slight delay compared to the main signal. If a new symbol starts arriving while echoes from the previous one are still present, the signals can overlap, causing errors in data interpretation.
By inserting a small time gap between symbols, the Guard Interval ensures that delayed reflections have time to dissipate before the next symbol arrives. This makes it easier for the receiver to distinguish between signals and accurately decode the transmitted data, improving the reliability and stability of the wireless connection—especially in indoor or complex environments.

Wi-Fi standards such as 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax support both standard guard intervals (e.g., 800 ns) and short guard intervals (e.g., 400 ns). Shortening the guard interval reduces the idle time between symbols, allowing more data to be transmitted in the same period.

This results in two major advantages:
- Higher data throughput, because more symbols are sent per second.
- Better spectral efficiency, meaning more effective use of the wireless bandwidth.
However, short guard intervals work best in environments with low multipath distortion, as they are more prone to interference in areas with significant signal reflection.

## 7. Describe the structure of an 802.11 PHY layer frame. What are its key components?
Ans : The PHY (Physical) layer frame in Wi-Fi is the format used to transmit data over the wireless medium. It consists of multiple sublayers and fields that ensure proper synchronization, data formatting, and reliable transmission.

- PPDU (PLCP Protocol Data Unit): The complete frame sent over the air. Composed of a preamble, header, and data (PSDU).
- PLCP (Physical Layer Convergence Protocol) Sublayer: Converts MAC layer data into a format suitable for transmission. Adds synchronization and control information.
- PMD (Physical Medium Dependent) Sublayer: Responsible for the actual transmission of bits over the radio. Modulates and converts bits into electromagnetic signals.

### Key Components of the PHY Frame:
- PLCP Preamble:   Used by the receiver to detect the start of a transmission and synchronize timing.
- PLCP Header: Contains information such as data rate, length, and modulation type.
- PSDU (MAC Protocol Data Unit): Actual data payload from the MAC layer.
- Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS): Determines how data is modulated and error-corrected during transmission.

## 12. How is Data Rate calculated?  

Ans : In Wi-Fi systems, especially those based on OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing), the data rate is calculated using parameters related to modulation, coding, and transmission time. The formula is:

Data Rate = (NSD × NBPSCS × R × NSS) / (TDFT + TGI), where

**NSD (Number of Data Subcarriers)**  
  - Number of subcarriers used to transmit data.  
  - Example: 52 (20 MHz, 802.11a), 234 (20 MHz, 802.11n), 980 (80 MHz, 802.11ax)

**NBPSCS (Bits Per SubCarrier per Symbol)**  
  - Depends on the modulation scheme:  
    - BPSK = 1, QPSK = 2, 16-QAM = 4, 64-QAM = 6, 256-QAM = 8, 1024-QAM = 10, 4096-QAM = 12

**R (Coding Rate)**  
  - Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding rate.  
  - Example values: 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6

**NSS (Number of Spatial Streams)**  
  - Number of MIMO streams used in transmission.  
  - More streams = higher throughput.

**TDFT (OFDM Symbol Duration)**  
  - Base duration of one OFDM symbol (e.g., 3.2 µs in Wi-Fi 4/5/6)

**TGI (Guard Interval)**  
  - Time added between symbols to avoid interference (e.g., 0.8 µs or 0.4 µs)
