DHCP Process
---------------------

The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) automatically assigns IP addresses and network settings to devices. It follows these four steps:

1.  Discovery (DHCPDISCOVER)
---------------------------------
- The client sends a broadcast request (0.0.0.0 → 255.255.255.255) to find DHCP servers.
- Uses UDP port 68 (Client) → 67 (Server).

2. Offer (DHCPOFFER)
---------------------------------
- A DHCP server responds with an available IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and lease time.
- Sent to the client’s MAC address.

3. Request (DHCPREQUEST)
---------------------------------
- The client accepts one offer and requests the assigned IP.
- Broadcasted to inform all DHCP servers.

4. Acknowledge (DHCPACK)
---------------------------------
- The server confirms the lease, finalizing the client’s network settings.
- The client can now communicate on the network.

Renewal & Expiry
------------------------
- Lease Renewal: Before expiry, the client sends a DHCPREQUEST to extend the lease.
- Rebinding: If the original server is unresponsive, the client asks another DHCP server.
