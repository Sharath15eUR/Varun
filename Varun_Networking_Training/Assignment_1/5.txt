What Happens in a Network Due to Duplicate IPs?

1. Network Disruption: Both devices may lose connectivity.
2. Intermittent Connectivity: The devices may take turns connecting and disconnecting.
3. Packet Loss: Data packets may not reach the intended device.
4. Security Risk: One device could impersonate the other, which might cause unauthorized access.


When two devices are configured with the same IP address in a network, IP address conflict occurs. This causes both devices to malfunction because the network cannot identify which device owns that IP address.

If duplicate IPs are present, more than one MAC address would be found ([92:BC:E4:5A:DA:FD])
