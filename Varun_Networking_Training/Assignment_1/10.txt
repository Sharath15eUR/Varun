Steps of DHCP Process:

1. DHCP Discover
	The client (your device) sends a broadcast request to find available DHCP servers.

2. DHCP Offer
	The DHCP server responds with an IP address offer to the client.

3. DHCP Request
	The client accepts the offer and requests the IP officially from the server.

4. DHCP Acknowledgment (ACK)
	The server confirms the IP lease and assigns the IP address to the client.

5. DHCP Lease Table Verification
