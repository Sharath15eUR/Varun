Importance of ARP in Packet Forwarding
----------------------------------------------

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is crucial because it translates IP addresses into MAC addresses. Devices need MAC addresses to send data within a local network.

When a device wants to send a packet:

1. It knows the destination IP address.
2. It uses ARP to find the corresponding MAC address.
3. The packet is then delivered using that MAC address.
4. Without ARP, devices wouldnâ€™t know where to send packets on a LAN.
5. It also helps forward packets to the default gateway (router) when sending data outside the network.

Basically the 00:00:00:00:00:00 is a broadcast IP where all the devices are sent a request signal to check which device (MAC Address) is connected to the particular IP.
Depending on the reply, the particular device is shown with its MAC address.
